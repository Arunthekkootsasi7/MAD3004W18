  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TUPLE AND DICTIONARY?

1 Dictinory can contain only one datatype value at a time.
  Tuple contains different values with different datatypes.
2 Dictinory needs key value pairs.
  Tuple won't need any key value pairs as it is a group of values represented as one value.
3 Tuple contains only predefined number of values.
  In dictionary there no limitations for values.
